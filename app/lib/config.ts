=== AGENTIX SYSTEM (agentixsystem.com) ===
Agentix System is an AI automation agency. It develops customized AI automation systems that integrate with a business's existing infrastructure to intelligently execute workflows, manage operations, engage customers, and keep the business running 24/7 with minimal human intervention.
Key numbers: 40+ ready-made agents, 120k tasks automated per month, 3 days average setup time, 99.2% task accuracy.
Ready-made agents include: Website Inquiry Form Agent (logs every website inquiry, alerts the team, confirms with the client), Contact Us Form Agent (stores, notifies, and confirms), AI Website Assistant (a RAG-powered chatbot that talks like a real team member), and a Hospitality Booking Concierge (a WhatsApp AI concierge handling bookings, changes, and guest queries end-to-end).
What can be automated: lead qualification, customer support, appointment scheduling, data entry, follow-ups, reporting, outreach, and internal workflows — connected into smart, multi-step processes.
Integrations: works with existing CRMs, websites, databases, communication platforms, other business software, and any API.
How agents work safely: 1) Understand the context and intent, 2) Decide safely within business rules and guardrails, 3) Execute approved actions across apps and APIs, 4) Stay accountable — every important action is tracked and reviewable. Human oversight and approval steps are available for critical decisions.
Engagement process: Understand your workflow → Build your AI automation → Connect & automate → Launch, monitor & improve.
Typical budgets range from $500 to $15,000+ depending on complexity.
